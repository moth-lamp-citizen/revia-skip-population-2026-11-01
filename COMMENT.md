**The report is green on a suite that runs; it is also green on a file whose tests all skip.**

I invoked the public runner at `31fc3b4` (`node <clone>/scripts/run-tracked-tests.js`) from a throwaway git repo whose entire tracked test population is one file with two `test(..., { skip: true })` calls and no assertions. The report:

```
status: 0, complete: true, working_tree_clean: true
intended = discovered = selected = executed = ["test/skipped.test.js"]
executions: [{file: "test/skipped.test.js", status: 0, signal: null, tests: 2, outcome: "passed"}]
```

The JUnit log the runner emitted for that file:

```
<!-- tests 2 -->  <!-- pass 0 -->  <!-- fail 0 -->  <!-- skipped 2 -->
```

`complete: true` and `outcome: "passed"` do not distinguish a file whose tests passed from a file whose tests all skipped. The file is in all four populations and the child exits 0; the report counts `tests`, not `pass`. If `passed` promises at least one passing test, this report is false. If it only means the file's process exited 0, the label is doing work the contract does not state. `parseExecutedTestCount` reads only `<!-- tests N -->` (`src/toolchain/tracked-test-runner.js` L363–367); `executed` keeps every file with `tests > 0` (L120–121); `outcome` is `passed` when `tests > 0` and the child status is 0 (L111–117). The validator recomputes the same rule (L294–295, L321–325), so the report is valid: `validateTrackedTestPopulationReport(report, {executionLog})` returned `{ok:true}`. The `pass` and `skipped` comments are in the log and are never read.

This is not only a synthetic cell. On a host with neither fixed-path openssl candidate (`/usr/bin/openssl`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/openssl`), both tests in `test/server-http-client-node-tls-transport.test.js` call `t.skip('fixed-path openssl unavailable')`. That file contributes zero passing tests, but its `tests` count is 2, so it is `executed` and `passed`, and `complete` can be true. I did not run Windows; the code path is the prediction. The pending Windows run is the case.

Positive controls, same clone: unmodified `31fc3b4`, 113/113 files, 971 test cases, 0 skipped, `complete:true`, `working_tree_clean:true`, exit 0. Adding an untracked `test/probe.test.js` gives `intended 1 / discovered 2 / selected 1 / executed 1`, `status:1`, `complete:false`. The runner catches the cells it names.

What would falsify this: a report where the all-skipped file is absent from `executed`, or `complete:false`, or `outcome` is not `passed`. I did not find one. The narrower claim is the one I can defend: a reader who checks `complete`/`outcome` alone cannot tell this file from a file with two passing tests.

Fix, depending on the unit you mean. If test execution is the unit, parse `<!-- pass N -->`, `<!-- skipped N -->`, `<!-- todo N -->`; add `passed`/`skipped` to each execution (or set `outcome:'skipped'` when `pass===0 && skipped>0`), and require `pass>0` for `outcome:'passed'` and for `executed`/`complete`. If file-level execution is the unit, say so in the contract and rename `outcome`/`complete` so `passed` does not mean "the process exited 0". The current code measures file-level execution; the current names promise test-level.

Receipts: https://github.com/moth-lamp-citizen/revia-skip-population-2026-11-01 — the one-file repo, its report and JUnit log, the validator run, the untracked-probe control (`untracked-probe-report.json`), and the 113-file control report. The clone is the public `31fc3b4`.
